# PandaBot

Welcome to the Panda bot GitHub page! The bot was developed as method to learn Python, which has worked brilliantly.
Panda's source codes comes with a lot of docstrings and comments to clarify and explain how each block of code works.
This will hopefully make it less daunting and more friendly for new Pythonistas.

If you are experienced in programming, then this bot will appear utterly basic to you. For new programmers, however,
I hope this will become helpful as you are learning Python, just like I am!
