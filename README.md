# PandaBot

This is my first Discord bot ever and is written in Python. I use this bot to practise my programming skills.
Currently, it has a few functionality. It has two minigames, namely a dice and an 8ball. It is also capable
of clearing message history, convert time and ping.

The way the bot is setup is really simple. main.py is the core of the bot, while config.py is where I have variables
that can easily be changed without diving into the codes in main.py.
